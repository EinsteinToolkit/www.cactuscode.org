Cactus is a direct descendant of many years of code development in Ed
Seidel\'s group of researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) as the group wrestled to numerically solve
Einstein\'s Equations for General Relativity and thus model black holes,
neutron stars, and boson stars.

In 1995, Ed Seidel and many of his group moved to the [Max Planck
Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute or
AEI)](http://www.aei.mpg.de) in Potsdam, Germany. Frustrated by the
difficulties of coordinating the development and use of several
different codes across a large collaborative group, Paul Walker, Joan
Massó, Ed Seidel, and John Shalf, designed and wrote the original
version of Cactus, Cactus 1.0, which provided a collaborative parallel
toolkit for numerical relativity.

As Cactus was used over the next years for research in Numerical
Relativity, it was realized that we could easily rewrite the code in
such a way that it could be used not just by numerical relativists, but
also by other computational scientists in other domains with similar
needs for large scale computing. This lead to a major redesign and
rewrite of Cactus, learning from all our previous experiences. In July
1999, Cactus 4.0 Beta 1 was finally released, with the main development
coming from Tom Goodale, Joan Massó³, Gabrielle Allen, Gerd Lanfermann
and John Shalf.

We are (unfortunately) still on the Cactus 4.0 release cycle, but lots
has happened since 1999. Cactus has been adopted not just by application
developers, but also by computer science researchers, and has been
involved in many prize winning efforts for large scale computing, grid
computing and high speed networks. More information about these awards
can be found on our News pages.

In 2003, several members of the AEI Cactus group left Germany to help
found the [Center for Computation & Technology
(CCT)](http://www.cct.lsu.edu/ "Center for Computation & Technology") at
[LSU](http://lsu.edu/)

with new director Ed Seidel. Cactus is now developed and supported by a
close-knit team spanning AEI and CCT.

Along the way, many other friends and colleagues have contributed to
Cactus, including Wai-Mo Suen, Thomas Dramlitsch, Thomas Schweizer,
Karen Camarda, Malcolm Tobias, Mark Miller, Ed Evans, Werner Benger,
Bernd Brügmann, Ian Hawke, Andre Merzky, and Bernard Schutz.
